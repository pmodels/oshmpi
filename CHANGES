======================================================================
                          Changes in 2.0b1
======================================================================

- Full support of OpenSHMEM 1.4 specification.

- Caching internal MPI communicators for collective operations with PE
  active set.

- Support multithreading OpenSHMEM safety. Internal POSIX mutex-based
  per-object critical sections are enabled to ensure thread-safety when
  using OSHMPI with multithreaded OpenSHMEM program (SHMEM_THREAD_MULTIPLE).
  See --enable-threads configure option.

- Active message support of OpenSHMEM atomic operations when the MPI library
  cannot ensure atomicity between MPI accumulates with different reduce
  operations. An MPI accumulates based version can be enabled by setting
  configure option --enable-amo=direct, or setting the OSHMPI_AMO_OPS
  environment variable at runtime.
